# Personality Prediction System via CV Analysis
## Overview:
- In today's competitive job market, understanding the personality traits of potential candidates can be invaluable for recruiters. By analyzing the contents of a CV, we can gain insights not only into a candidate's professional qualifications but also infer certain personality traits. This repository aims to leverage the power of machine learning to make such predictions.
- This project demonstrates a machine learning-based approach to predict personality traits using a dataset containing information about individuals' gender, age, and scores on the "Big Five" personality traits: openness, neuroticism, conscientiousness, agreeableness, and extraversion.

## Prerequisites

- A Google account to access [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
- A Kaggle account for [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/) download.

## Setup

1. **Google Colab Initialization**:
    - Open Google Colab and create a new Python3 notebook.
    - Set your runtime type to GPU for faster computation through `Runtime > Change runtime type`.

2. **Kaggle Dataset Download**:
         Download your desired dataset from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pavlorymarchuk/test3434) or Clone the repo You can either:
    - Upload it directly to Google Colab using the upload button in the sidebar.
    - Save the dataset to Google Drive and access it from Colab using `drive.mount('/content/drive')`.
## the high result 
- Accuracy (Logistic Regression): 83.49 %
